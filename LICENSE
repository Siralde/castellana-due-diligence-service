GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)

Castellana Due Diligence Service is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

This license ensures that Castellana remains free and open-source, with a strong copyleft—meaning:

You are free to use, modify, and distribute the software.

If you run Castellana Due Diligence Service as a network service (e.g., via castellana.vc or your own hosted version), and users interact with it, you must also make the source code—including any modifications—available to those users.

This closes the "SaaS loophole" found in other open-source licenses, ensuring the community benefits from all improvements, even if the software is only used over the web.
